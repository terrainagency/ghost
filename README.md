# Ghost-UI
Ghost is a library of foundational code blocks, designed for practical use on projects built with GSAP and Tailwind.

Ghost's code is non-obtrusive, and does not create any actions without implicit direction. It is designed to be as agnostic as possible, allowing the library to function freely accross a large variety of applications.

Version: 0.9

# TailwindCSS

In order to simplify the experience of building Tailwind sites, the connection of Ghost-UI and DOM elements has been carefully designed to be clear and concise within HTML documents.

All Ghost objects and components are connected to DOM elements via id and class names that begin with `@`, and utilize `data-` attributes for configuration.
